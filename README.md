# blog-aggregator

This is a project I created as part of my upskilling on boot.dev. It is a CLI project that can be used to read RSS feeds and save them to a database. Some commands you can run are
* login (user name)
* register (user name)
* addfeed (feed name, url)
* follow (url)
* agg (time e.g. 5s) 

## requirements
* Go
* Postgres
